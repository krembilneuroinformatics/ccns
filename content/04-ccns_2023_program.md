### CCNSv4 will take place on October 5-6, 2023, and registration is open [here](https://www.crowdcast.io/c/ccnsv4).

### Submit your abstract for a Trainee Talk [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeev-EA5ccwKapzRV43xD4NfDYGyDeAiWpTuv4b_7GKkrWPOQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) by September 1 for full consideration.

# About CCNSv4:
## What's new in v4?
This year, CCNS will be a “sibling meeting” to the Krembil Computational Neuroscience Symposium taking place (in person in Toronto) on October 2-3. Taking place the same week (October 5-6), CCNS will capitalize on this momentum in the Canadian computational neuroscience community with an even stronger emphasis on trainee engagement, including workshop-style sessions and more opportunity for spotlighted trainee talks.

## What's returning from previous editions?
CCNS will include three keynote addresses from world-class computational neuroscientists. Our continuing “trainee focus” will include more opportunities for spotlighted trainee talks alongside additional parallel sessions. Like each previous CCNS, the meeting will be entirely virtual, allowing for zero registration costs and material that is available online for replay indefinitely.

## Who is speaking?
CCNSv4's three keynote speakers, Dr. Rick Adams, Dr. Jeremie Lefebvre, and Dr. Sarah Muldoon, are confirmed. Members of the organizing committee will compliment these keynote addresses with “workshop-style” sessions to provide hands-on experience in related topics. The remaining talks will be from selected trainees.
The list of speakers and meeting schedule will be updated at ccnsmeeting.ca on a rolling basis.

## I want to give a trainee talk! What should I do?
We invite trainees to submit abstracts for talks covering any subject falling under the broad banner of computational neuroscience. To do so, fill out this Google Form. We anticipate all submissions that reasonably fall under the broad banner of "computational neuroscience" will be accepted unless the demand far exceeds our expectations.

Submissions before September 1 at 5 pm EDT will be considered for longer “spotlight” presentations, with preference given to topics that compliment the topics of our keynote speakers (computational study of epilepsy, psychiatry, myelin, and the stability/resilience of neuronal circuits). The exact length of the talks will depend on demand and be established when our schedule is finalized, no later than September 18.

## Wait, do I have to be Canadian to attend or present?
This meeting was first designed as a “Canadian” spotlight event considering the COVID-19 related cancellations or postponements of many neuroscience meetings in Canada specifically. However, the meeting quickly grew to not only include an international group of speakers, but also attendees from across the globe. As such, while we endeavor to shine a spotlight on the burgeoning computational neuroscience community within Canada, this meeting is designed for an international audience, and everyone is encouraged to register and apply for trainee talks.
