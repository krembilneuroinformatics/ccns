## About the Organizing Committee

[**Dr. Scott Rich**](http://scottrich.strikingly.com/) ([@RichCompNeuro](https://twitter.com/RichCompNeuro), ***CCNS lead organizer***) is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Krembil Research Institute.
His research aims to elucidate the multi-scale interactions driving physiological brain activity by better understanding how they are disrupted in epilepsy, a distinctly multi-scale pathology. This work includes a focus on distinctly human epilepsy by integrating human electrophysiological data into the modeling process.

[**Dr. Andreea Diaconescu**](cognemo.com) ([@cognemo_andreea](https://twitter.com/cognemo_andreea), ***CCNS co-organizer***) is currently an Independent Scientist at the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. Leading the Cognitive Network Modelling team, her research focuses on developing cognitive tasks and computational models that address specific symptoms in psychiatry with a particular focus on delusions. In combination with neuroimaging and electrophysiological recordings, the aim is to assess the clinical utility of these models in prospective patient studies

[**Dr. John Griffiths**](grifflab.com) ([@neurodidact](https://twitter.com/neurodidact), ***CCNS co-organizer***) is a cognitive and computational neuroscientist, with particular research interests in mathematical modelling of large-scale neural dynamics, multimodal neuroimaging data analysis methods, and brain stimulation in the context of neuropsychiatric and neurological disease. He is currently an Independent Scientist at the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at CAMH, where he leads a team focused on whole-brain and multi-scale neurophysiological modelling. He is also an Assistant Professor in the University of Toronto Departments of Psychiatry and Institute of Medical Sciences.  

[**Dr. Milad Lankarany**](https://sites.google.com/view/lnsbsp/home) ([@MLankarany](https://twitter.com/MLankarany), ***CCNS co-organizer***) is an Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto Instiute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, and a Scientist at the Krembil Research Institute. The main focus of his lab's work is to uncover information processing mechanisms of neural systems. His goal is to understand how information is represented, propagated and computed. Understanding neural information processing will result in the development of computational algorithms and engineering techniques for the optimal controlling of the functionality of neural systems. For example, closed loop neuro-stimulators can be used to adaptively intervene with the neural system of patients with neurological disorders in order to restore the normal activity.
