## CCNSv3 External Session Chairs 
[**Dr. Alexandra Chatzikalymniou**](https://twitter.com/Alex_Pierri_C): Dr. Chatzikalymniou has a Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Patras, Greece. She completed her PhD at the University of Toronto under the supervision of Dr. Frances Skinner, where she investigated the generation mechanism of theta rhythms in the hippocampus. She is currently a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University at the lab of Dr. Ivan Soltesz, where she studies hippocampal sharp-wave ripples during behavior.

[**Dr. Randy McIntosh**](https://www.armcintosh.com/home): Dr. McIntosh's research program involves computational modeling and brain imaging to explore changes in cognition across the lifespan and changes in the face of brain damage or disease. The program builds on an international collaboration that delivered TheVirtualBrain (thevirtualbrain.org) and integrates research efforts globally to accelerate research and translation. The goals are 1) to integrate the modeling platform into the standard workflow for clinical decision support, and 2) develop a cloud-based system where anyone can create brain models for research, clinical use, or education.

[**Dr. Povilas Karvelis**](https://cognemo.com/karvelis/): Dr. Povilas Karvelis is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Cognitive Network Modelling lab at the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. His primary research is focused on developing computational models of the vulnerabilities underlying suicidality. The purpose of these models is two-fold. First, it can help formalize our understanding of suicidality across different levels of analysis (neural, behavioral, phenomenological, social). Second, these exact models could (eventually) be used in clinical practice to aid diagnosis and guide personalized care.

He completed his MD/PhD at McGill University, where his doctoral research focused on pain processing in the spinal cord. He opted not to pursue a clinical medicine and focused instead on fundamental research. He undertook postdoctoral training in computational neuroscience at the Salk Institute in San Diego before starting his own lab at the University of Pittsburgh. In 2012, he moved to SickKids. His lab seeks to uncover how somatosensory information in normally encoded and how disruption of that coding contributes to neuropathic pain. His lab combines a variety of experimental techniques (electrophysiology, calcium imaging, optogenetics) with computational modeling
* [**Dr. Carmen Canavier**](https://www.medschool.lsuhsc.edu/cell_biology/faculty_detail.aspx?name=canavier_carmen): Dr. Canavier is a theoretical and computational neuroscientist who is interested in nonlinear neuronal dynamics and synchronization of pulse coupled oscillators. She works on delineating the biophysical basis for diversity in subpopulations of midbrain dopamine neurons, on mechanisms of hippocampal gamma oscillations, and on neuromodulation of intrinsic dynamics. She received her PhD in electrical and computer engineering from Rice University and did her postdoctoral research at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center at Houston. She is the Mullins Professor and Interim Head of the Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy at LSU Health Sciences Center in New Orleans.
* [**Dr. Gaute Einevoll**](https://www.mn.uio.no/fysikk/english/people/aca/geinevol/index.html): Gaute Einevoll is a professor of physics at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences and the University of Oslo working on brain physics, in particular, physics-type modelling of nerve cells, networks of nerve cells, brain tissue and brain signals. He is participating in the large-scale EU Human Brain Project started in 2013 and scheduled to end in 2023.
* **Dr. Richard Naud**: Richard Naud is originally from Montreal. He studied Physics and Neuroscience at McGill, EPFL, Cambridge (UK) and TU Berlin. His lab at the University of Ottawa focuses on the learning and the information processing capabilities of neuronal networks

* [**Dr. Kelly Shen**](https://www.sfu.ca/neuro-institute/about/governance/staff/kelly-shen.html): Dr. Kelly Shen is the Senior Program Manager and Informatics Team Lead for the Institute for Neuroscience and Neurotechnology at Simon Fraser University. She led the development of The Virtual Macaque Brain, a macaque connectome for modelling brain dynamics in TheVirtualBrain. More recently, her research has focused on understanding the network dynamics that underlie cognitive function in aging and dementia and has led the development of an automated multi-modal MRI pipeline for processing ‘big data’ inputs for large-scale modelling.

Her background is engineering and her main interests lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and neuroscience. Her research revolves around the link between structure and function in biological brain networks.
