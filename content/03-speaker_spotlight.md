## Session Chairs for CCNSv2
[Dr. Maurizio de Pitta](https://sites.google.com/site/mauriziodepitta/): Maurizio De Pitta is joining the Krembil Research Institute, setting up his lab at the Institute by August 2021. He is currently ‘la Caixa’ Junior Leader Research Fellow at the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics in Bilbao, Spain where he carries out multidisciplinary research in Applied Mathematics with emphasis on translational and clinical topics in the Neurosciences. Maurizio pioneers computational approaches to quantify and replicate neuron-glial interactions in the brain, with the aim to elucidate their role in cognition and pathology. He is co-author of the first book on “Computational Glioscience” by Springer (2019).

[Dr. Etay Hay](https://www.haybrainlab.com/research): Dr. Etay Hay is an Independent Scientist at Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and the Department of Physiology at the University of Toronto. Dr. Hay’s research uses computational models of cortical microcircuits to study the mechanisms of brain processing in health and mental disorders. Dr. Hay and his team integrate human cellular, circuit and gene-expression data to develop detailed computational models of human cortical microcircuits in health, depression and schizophrenia. The Hay lab uses the models to better understand the neuronal circuit mechanisms of brain function and mental health, test in silico new pharmacology for treatment, and identify high-resolution biomarkers in clinically-relevant brain signals to improve the diagnosis and monitoring of mental health.

[Dr. Carmen Canavier](https://www.medschool.lsuhsc.edu/neuroscience/faculty_detail.aspx?name=canavier_carmen): Carmen Canavier is the Mullins Professor and Chair, Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, School of Medicine, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center at New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO). She is a computational neuroscientist studying synchronization of pulse-coupled oscillators and the nonlinear dynamics of neurons and neural circuits. Her current interests focus on the dopamine neurons that participate in basal ganglia circuits and on gamma and theta oscillations in the hippocampus.
