## External Session Chairs for CCNSv3
[**Dr. Alexandra Chatzikalymniou**](https://twitter.com/Alex_Pierri_C): Dr. Chatzikalymniou has a Bachelor's Degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Patras, Greece. She completed her PhD at the University of Toronto under the supervision of Dr. Frances Skinner, where she investigated the generation mechanism of tehta rhythms in the hippocampus. She is currently a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University at the lab of Dr. Ivan Soltesz, where she studies hippocampal sharp-wave ripples during behavior.

[**Dr. Randy McIntosh**](https://www.armcintosh.com/home): Dr. Mcintosh's research program involves computational modeling and brain imaging to explore changes in cognition across the lifespan and changes in the face of brain damage or disease. The program builds on an international collaboration that delivered TheVirtualBrain (thevirtualbrain.org) and integrates research efforts globally to accelerate research and translation. The goals are 1) to integrate the modeling platform into the standard workflow for clinical decision support, and 2) develop a cloud-based system where anyone can create brain models for research, clinical use, or education.

[**Dr. Povilas Karvelis**](https://cognemo.com/karvelis/): Dr. Povilas Karvelis is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Cognitive Network Modelling lab at the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. His primary research is focused on developing computational models of the vulnerabilities underlying suicidality. The purpose of these models is two-fold. First, it can help formalize our understanding of suicidality across different levels of analysis (neural, behavioral, phenomenological, social). Second, these exact models could (eventually) be used in clinical practice to aid diagnosis and guide personalized care.
