## CCNSv4 Keynote Speakers
[**Dr. Rick Adams**](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=RAADA06): Dr. Rick Adams studied medicine and neuroscience at Cambridge University and did his PhD under Prof Karl Friston in UCL. He did post doctoral fellowships with Prof Jon Roiser and Prof Janaina Mourao-Miranda (both UCL) and now is a Future Leaders Fellow with his own lab spanning the Centre for Medical Image Computing and Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at UCL. He also works as a Consultant Psychiatrist specialising in psychosis and neuropsychiatry. His research interest is in using computational modelling of both behaviour and brain imaging data to try to understand underlying cognitive or neurobiological processes contributing to psychosis spectrum disorders.

[**Dr. Jeremie Lefebvre**](https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-science/professors/jeremie-lefebvre): Jeremie Lefebvre is an Associate Professor at the Department of Biology and Physics of the University of Ottawa and Affiliate Scientist at the Krembil Research Institute. He also holds appointments at the Department of Mathematics of the University of Toronto. Prof Lefebvre was trained in Ottawa, Nancy, Geneva and Lausanne, developing his expertise in non-linear dynamics and neurophysiology. His team uses interdisciplinary methods to better understand the roles of noise, non-linearity and diversity in brain function â€“ and what goes wrong in diseases such as epilepsy and multiple-sclerosis.

[**Dr. Sarah Muldoon**](https://sites.google.com/site/sarahfeldtmuldoon/): Dr. Sarah Muldoon is an Associate Professor in the Mathematics Department, Interim Director of the Graduate Program in Computational and Data-Enabled Science within the Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, and member of the Neuroscience Program at the University at Buffalo, SUNY.  Her research interests lie at the intersection of experiment and theory with a focus on applications of network theory to neuroscience data. She has spent extensive time working in experimental neurobiology labs and now runs a research group that couples theoretical advancement, computational modeling, and data-intensive analysis to study the relationship between structure and function in brain networks.
