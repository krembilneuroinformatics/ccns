## Session Chairs for CCNSv2
[**Dr. Maurizio de Pitta**](https://sites.google.com/site/mauriziodepitta/): Maurizio De Pitta is joining the Krembil Research Institute, setting up his lab at the Institute by August 2021. He is currently ‘la Caixa’ Junior Leader Research Fellow at the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics in Bilbao, Spain where he carries out multidisciplinary research in Applied Mathematics with emphasis on translational and clinical topics in the Neurosciences. Maurizio pioneers computational approaches to quantify and replicate neuron-glial interactions in the brain, with the aim to elucidate their role in cognition and pathology. He is co-author of the first book on “Computational Glioscience” by Springer (2019).

[**Dr. Etay Hay**](https://www.haybrainlab.com/research): Dr. Etay Hay is an Independent Scientist at Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and the Department of Physiology at the University of Toronto. Dr. Hay’s research uses computational models of cortical microcircuits to study the mechanisms of brain processing in health and mental disorders. Dr. Hay and his team integrate human cellular, circuit and gene-expression data to develop detailed computational models of human cortical microcircuits in health, depression and schizophrenia. The Hay lab uses the models to better understand the neuronal circuit mechanisms of brain function and mental health, test in silico new pharmacology for treatment, and identify high-resolution biomarkers in clinically-relevant brain signals to improve the diagnosis and monitoring of mental health.

[**Dr. Carmen Canavier**](https://www.medschool.lsuhsc.edu/neuroscience/faculty_detail.aspx?name=canavier_carmen): Carmen Canavier is the Mullins Professor and Chair, Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, School of Medicine, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center at New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO). She is a computational neuroscientist studying synchronization of pulse-coupled oscillators and the nonlinear dynamics of neurons and neural circuits. Her current interests focus on the dopamine neurons that participate in basal ganglia circuits and on gamma and theta oscillations in the hippocampus.

[**Dr. Bratislav Misic**](https://netneurolab.github.io/): Bratislav Misic is a mathematician with expertise in neuroimaging and network science. He joined McGill University in 2016, where he lads the Network Neuroscience Lab. His group studies how the links and interactions among brain areas support cognitive operations, complex behavior and global dynamics. 



## Speakers for CCNSv2
* [Dr. Richard Naud](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=2HXsblgAAAAJ&hl=en__;!!CjcC7IQ!ch9OLWSWIM_a77n33MattBtYGbo2KHGPL3HJfGsbpdVmlUJzCpMVtdbqWHorba0IkiIDyw$): Richard Naud is a computational neuroscience researcher and associate professor at the University of Ottawa. His work focuses on the information processing capabilities of cortical neural networks.
* [Dr. Gianluigi Mongillo](http://www.aging-vision-action.fr/people/gianluigi-mongillo/): Gianluigi Mongillo received a M.Sc. degree in Physics (in 2000) and a Ph.D. degree in Neurophysiology (in 2005) from the University of Rome “La Sapienza,” (Rome, Italy). Since 2009, Gianluigi has been a research scientist with the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS).
* [Dr. Sukbin Lim](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/faculty/directory/sukbin-lim): Sukbim Lim is an Assistant Professor of Neural Science, NYU Shanghai; Global Network Assistant Professor, NYU. Sukbim’s research uses a broad spectrum of dynamical systems theory, the theory of stochastic processes, and information and control theories, to develop and analyzes neural network models and synaptic plasticity rules for learning and memory.
* [Dr. Yulia Dembitskaya](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yulia-Dembitskaya): Yulia Dembitskaya is a neuroscientist at the College de France’s Team in Dynamics and Pathophysiology of Neuronal Networks and a researcher at the Department of Molecular Neurobiology Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of the Russian Academy of Science in Moscow, Russia. Yulia’s research focuses on cellular neuroscience, specifically on neuron-glia interactions and how they take part in memory formation mechanisms in the normal and diseased brain, emphasizing Huntington's, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s diseases.
* Dr. Michael London
* Dr. Alexandre Guet-McCreight
* Dr. Steve Prescott
* Dr. Paola Malerba
* [Dr. Jonathan Rubin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JbwuImwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra): Since receiving his PhD in Applied Math from Brown University in 1996, Jonathan Rubin has been engaged in research in mathematical neuroscience and other topics at the interface of biology and dynamics, with specializations in bursting, rhythm generation, multiple timescale dynamics, and basal ganglia/Parkinson’s disease.  Rubin has mentored over 20 PhD students and postdocs and is a member of the 2021 Class of SIAM Fellows.
* Dr. Alexandra Chatziklaymniou
* [Dr. André Longtin](https://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/alongtin/): Andre Longtin is a Professor of Physics at the University of Ottawa, and co-director of its Centre for Neural Dynamics. He works in nonlinear dynamics, stochastic dynamics and nonlinear time series analysis. He also pursue related research in computational and theoretical neuroscience from synapses to whole brain activity and behaviour, including sensory coding, feedback, memory, rhythms, active sensing and model inference through machine learning.
* Dr. Emma Towlson
* [Dr. Amy Kuceyski](https://www.cocolaboratory.com/): Amy Kuceyeski is an Associate Professor of Mathematics in the Radiology Department at Weill Cornell Medicine and PI of the Computational Connectomics (CoCo) Lab. For the past decade, Amy has been interested in understanding how the human brain works in order to better diagnose, prognose and treat neurological disease and injury. The CoCo lab's main focus is on using quantitative methods, including machine learning, applied to multi-modal neuroimaging data to map brain-behavior relationships and boost recovery after neurological disease or injury.
* Dr. Caio Seguin
* Dr. Richard Betzel
