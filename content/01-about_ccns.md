About CCNS
The Canadian Computational Neuroscience Spotlight (CCNS) was created following the mass cancellations and postponements 
of traditional neuroscience conferences during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, including two such meetings 
amongst the Canadian neuroscience community. The absence of these meetings presented an opportunity to create a brand-new, 
entirely virtual academic meeting that could take full advantage of the online setting. Given that traditionally-defined 
trainees and early-career researchers were arguably most impacted by the cancellation of the networking and learning 
opportunities that conferences present, CCNS was designed as a “trainee-focused” meeting, highlighted by tutorial talks 
beginning each session, panel discussions with both established and early-career scientists, and a spotlight on trainee 
presentations.

The first edition of CCNS was planned and implemented entirely in ten weeks and yielded a meeting with more than 450
registrants, including representation from every continent across the globe. Perhaps most importantly, the limited costs
of the virtual setting allowed the meeting to be completely free of charge for all attendees. Every element of the meeting
remains available for replay online, another benefit of the virtual setting. This success served as the impetus for making
CCNS a recurring academic meeting.

Going forward, CCNS will continue to highlight cutting-edge computational neuroscience research, both in Canada and around
the world, while providing unique learning, networking, and presentation opportunities for early-career researchers. The
meeting is committed to remaining cost-accessible to the entire academic community, using the virtual setting to maximize
accessibility for populations for which physical conferences present a challenge, and maintaining a gender-balanced and
diverse lineup of speakers during its continued evolution.
