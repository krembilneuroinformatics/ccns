of traditional neuroscience conferences during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, including two such meetings
amongst the Canadian neuroscience community. The absence of these meetings presented an opportunity to create a brand-new,
entirely virtual academic meeting that could take full advantage of the online setting. Given that traditionally-defined
trainees and early-career researchers were arguably most impacted by the cancellation of the networking and learning
opportunities that conferences present, CCNS was designed as a “trainee-focused” meeting, highlighted by tutorial talks
beginning each session, panel discussions with both established and early-career scientists, and a spotlight on trainee
presentations.</p><p>The <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008485">first edition of CCNS</a> was planned and implemented entirely in ten weeks and yielded a meeting with more than 450
registrants, including representation from every continent across the globe. Perhaps most importantly, the limited costs
of the virtual setting allowed the meeting to be completely free of charge for all attendees. Every element of the meeting
remains available for replay online, another benefit of the virtual setting. This success served as the impetus for making
CCNS a recurring academic meeting.</p><p>Going forward, CCNS will continue to highlight cutting-edge computational neuroscience research, both in Canada and around
the world, while providing unique learning, networking, and presentation opportunities for early-career researchers. The
meeting is committed to remaining cost-accessible to the entire academic community, using the virtual setting to maximize
accessibility for populations for which physical conferences present a challenge, and maintaining a gender-balanced and
diverse lineup of speakers during its continued evolution.</p></article><article id=02-organizing-committee><h2 class=major>02 - Organizing Committee</h2><span class="image main"><img src alt></span><figure class="image main"><img src=images/screenshot.png></figure><h2 id=about-the-organizing-committee>About the Organizing Committee</h2><p><a href=http://scottrich.strikingly.com/><strong>Dr. Scott Rich</strong></a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/RichCompNeuro>@RichCompNeuro</a>, <em><strong>CCNS lead organizer</strong></em>) is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Neuron to Brain laboratory team lead at the Krembil Brain Institute.
His research aims to elucidate the multi-scale interactions driving physiological brain activity by better understanding how they are disrupted in epilepsy, a distinctly multi-scale pathology. This work includes a focus on distinctly human epilepsy by integrating human electrophysiological data into the modeling process at varied spatial scales, ranging from biophysically detailed single neuron models to neural mass models.</p><p><a href=cognemo.com><strong>Dr. Andreea Diaconescu</strong></a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/cognemo_andreea>@cognemo_andreea</a>, <em><strong>CCNS co-organizer</strong></em>) is currently an Independent Scientist at the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.

Understanding neural information processing will result in the development of computational algorithms and engineering techniques for the optimal controlling of the functionality of neural systems. For example, closed loop neuro-stimulators can be used to adaptively intervene with the neural system of patients with neurological disorders in order to restore the normal activity.</p></article><article id=03-speaker-spotlight><h2 class=major>03- Speaker Spotlight</h2><span class="image main"><img src alt></span><figure class="image main"><img src=images/SessionChairs_v1.png></figure><h2 id=ccnsv3-external-session-chairs>CCNSv3 External Session Chairs</h2><p><a href=https://twitter.com/Alex_Pierri_C><strong>Dr. Alexandra Chatzikalymniou</strong></a>: Dr. Chatzikalymniou has a Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Patras, Greece.
