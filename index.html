of traditional neuroscience conferences during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, including two such meetings
amongst the Canadian neuroscience community. The absence of these meetings presented an opportunity to create a brand-new,
entirely virtual academic meeting that could take full advantage of the online setting. Given that traditionally-defined
trainees and early-career researchers were arguably most impacted by the cancellation of the networking and learning
opportunities that conferences present, CCNS was designed as a “trainee-focused” meeting, highlighted by tutorial talks
beginning each session, panel discussions with both established and early-career scientists, and a spotlight on trainee
presentations.</p><p>The <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008485">first edition of CCNS</a> was planned and implemented entirely in ten weeks and yielded a meeting with more than 450
registrants, including representation from every continent across the globe. Perhaps most importantly, the limited costs
of the virtual setting allowed the meeting to be completely free of charge for all attendees. Every element of the meeting
remains available for replay online, another benefit of the virtual setting. This success served as the impetus for making
CCNS a recurring academic meeting.</p><p>Going forward, CCNS will continue to highlight cutting-edge computational neuroscience research, both in Canada and around
the world, while providing unique learning, networking, and presentation opportunities for early-career researchers. The
meeting is committed to remaining cost-accessible to the entire academic community, using the virtual setting to maximize
accessibility for populations for which physical conferences present a challenge, and maintaining a gender-balanced and
diverse lineup of speakers during its continued evolution.</p></article><article id=02-organizing-committee><h2 class=major>02 - Organizing Committee</h2><span class="image main"><img src alt></span><figure class="image main"><img src=images/screenshot.png></figure><h2 id=about-the-organizing-committee>About the Organizing Committee</h2><p><a href=http://scottrich.strikingly.com/><strong>Dr. Scott Rich</strong></a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/RichCompNeuro>@RichCompNeuro</a>, <em><strong>CCNS lead organizer</strong></em>) is currently a Research Fellow at SickKids Research Institute and an <a href="https://twitter.com/RichCompNeuro/status/1676958486146715652?s=20">incoming Assistant Professor at the University of Connecticut&rsquo;s Department of Physiology and Neurobiology in January 2024</a>.

Administration of positive allosteric modulators of α5 subunit-containing GABAA receptor (α5-PAM) that selectively target this lost inhibition exhibit antidepressant and pro-cognitive effects in rodent models of chronic stress. However, the functional effects of α5-PAM on the human brain in vivo are unknown, and currently cannot be assessed experimentally. We modeled the effects of α5-PAM on tonic inhibition as measured in human neurons, and tested in silico α5-PAM effects on detailed models of human cortical microcircuits in health and depression. We found that α5-PAM effectively recovered impaired cortical processing as quantified by stimulus detection metrics, and also recovered the power spectral density profile of the microcircuit EEG signals. We performed an α5-PAM dose response and identified simulated EEG biomarker candidates. Our results serve to de-risk and facilitate α5-PAM translation and provide biomarkers in non-invasive brain signals for monitoring target engagement and drug efficacy.</li><li><strong>Andrea Luppi</strong>: Patterns of neural activity underlie human cognition. Transitions between these patterns are orchestrated by the brain’s network architecture. What are the mechanisms linking network structure to cognitively relevant activation patterns? Here we implement principles of network control to investigate how the architecture of the human connectome shapes transitions between 123 experimentally defined cognitive activation maps (cognitive topographies) from the NeuroSynth meta-analytic engine. We also systematically incorporate neurotransmitter receptor density maps (18 receptors and transporters) and disease-related cortical abnormality maps (11 neurodegenerative, psychiatric and neurodevelopmental diseases; N = 17 000 patients, N = 22 000 controls). Integrating large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data from functional MRI, diffusion tractography, cortical morphometry, and positron emission tomography, we simulate how anatomically-guided transitions between cognitive states can be reshaped by pharmacological or pathological perturbation. Our results provide a comprehensive look-up table charting how brain network organisation and chemoarchitecture interact to manifest different cognitive topographies. This computational framework establishes a principled foundation for systematically identifying novel ways to promote selective transitions between desired cognitive topographies.</li></ul><h3 id=spotlight-thursday-400-430-pm-edt>Spotlight, Thursday 4:00-4:30 PM EDT</h3><ul><li><strong>Laura Green</strong>: Intrinsic activity of a circuit shapes the way we encode information and respond to our environment. Recent work suggests disinhibition plays a role in shaping place cell activity in the hippocampal CA1 region. From a computational perspective, disinhibition provides a mechanism for self-sustained activity, suggesting attractor-like activity in CA1 without the need for recurrent excitation. Most previous studies on attractor dynamics utilize recurrent excitation, as is the case in the CA3 region. In turn, it is tacitly assumed that the target CA1 region functions simply as a relay or output node, without exploiting the computational properties of CA1 circuitry. In a reduced firing rate model, we confirm that disinhibition coupled with broad lateral inhibition can lead to attractor dynamics. That is, with spatially uniform and strong enough input to excitatory and inhibitory cells the distributed rate model is capable of a spatially-localized ‘bump’ of activity. We then develop a spiking population model of CA1 place cell activity based on the same circuitry. We model place cell activity along a linear track in response to spatiotemporal input. Compared to all-to-all circuitry, the model with disinhibition offers improved signal-to-noise and more stable maintenance of temporal organization of place cell activity in response to changes in input. We further extend the model to demonstrate that disinhibition can sustain intrinsic sequential activity. These observations are consistent with known functions of attractor models and proposed roles of the hippocampus, to compress information while maintaining encodability.</li><li><strong>Shervin Safavi</strong>: Multiple studies have reported signatures of criticality observed in various neuronal recordings. Moreover, theoretical investigations demonstrate that multiple aspects of information processing are optimized at the second-order phase transition. These studies motivated the hypothesis that the brain operates close to a critical state. While it has been shown that several computational aspects of sensory information processing are optimal in this regime, it is still unclear whether these computational benefits of criticality can be leveraged by neural systems for performing behaviorally relevant computations [3]. To address this question, we consider a network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons that is optimized for efficient coding. Previously, it was shown that the performance of such networks varies non-monotonically with the noise amplitude [4]. We consider networks with different noise amplitudes and evaluate how close they are to the critical state by measuring deviations from the nearest power law of avalanche size distributions. We find that in the vicinity of the optimal noise level for efficient coding, the network dynamics exhibits signatures of criticality, namely, the distribution of avalanche sizes is closest to a power law. When the noise amplitude is too low or too high for efficient coding, the network appears either super-critical or sub-critical, respectively. Lastly, we verify the stability of this result to changes in the network’s size and observed a similar behavior. This result has important implications, as it shows how two influential, and previously disparate fields - efficient coding, and criticality - might be intimately related.</li></ul><h3 id=spotlight-friday-900-930-am-edt>Spotlight, Friday 9:00-9:30 AM EDT</h3><ul><li><strong>Yuhua Yu</strong>: Temporal variability is a fundamental property of brain processes and functionally important to human cognition. This study examined how fluctuations in neural oscillatory activity are related to problem-solving performance. We used volatility to assess the step-by-step fluctuations of EEG spectral power while individuals attempted to solve word-association puzzles. Inspired by recent results with hidden-state modeling, we tested the hypothesis that spectral-power volatility is directly associated with problem-solving outcomes. As predicted, volatility was lower during trials solved with insight compared to those solved analytically. Moreover, volatility during pre-stimulus preparation for solving predicted general problem-solving outcomes, including solving-success and solving-time. These novel findings were replicated in a separate dataset from an anagram-solving task, suggesting that less-rapid transitions between neural oscillatory synchronization and desynchronization predict better solving performance and are conducive to solving with insight. Thus, volatility can be a valuable index to characterize brain dynamics relevant to cognition.</li><li><strong>Carol Upchurch</strong>: Persistent activity in excitatory principal cells has been suggested as a mechanism to maintain memory traces during working memory. Persistent interruption of firing in PV+ inhibitory interneurons has been demonstrated and suggested to be the inhibitory counterpart of persistent activity in excitatory neurons. Since an interruption in inhibitory interneuronal firing disinhibits the excitatory principal cells, it could serve a similar function. We find the mechanism is similar in models of neocortical and hippocampal area CA1 fast spiking interneurons. An inhibitory synaptic potential or hyperpolarizing current that decays sufficiently slowly is applied to a repetitively firing interneuron. This stimulus removes inactivation from rapidly activating, slowly inactivating potassium current KV1, bringing the membrane potential to a temporary equilibrium above the spike threshold during repetitive firing. After the stimulus has faded, KV1 continues to de-inactivate slowly until KV1 is sufficiently weak that repetitive firing can be reestablished. A reduced model using the inactivation variable as a bifurcation parameter shows the initial stimulus collapses the limit cycle for repetitive firing onto a co-existing stable fixed point corresponding to depolarization block. As this variable decays, the trajectory crosses a supercritical Hopf bifurcation following the curve of unstable fixed points until it spirals out into repetitive firing. In an alternative model describing entorhinal cortical PV+ interneurons, similar behavior is achieved without a slowly activating/inactivating gated current. When the baseline current is close enough to a Hopf bifurcation, the fixed point is weakly repelling, taking hundreds of milliseconds to resume firing after an interruption.</li></ul></article><article id=05-past-future><h2 class=major>05 - Past & Future</h2><span class="image main"><img src alt></span><h2 id=previous-years>Previous Years</h2><h3 id=ccns-2022>CCNS 2022</h3><p>The full program of talks at CCNSv3, including sessions chaired by Dr. Alexandra Chatzikalymniou, Dr. Randy McIntosh, Dr. Milad Lankarany, and Drs.
