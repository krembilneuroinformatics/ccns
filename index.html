of traditional neuroscience conferences during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, including two such meetings
amongst the Canadian neuroscience community. The absence of these meetings presented an opportunity to create a brand-new,
entirely virtual academic meeting that could take full advantage of the online setting. Given that traditionally-defined
trainees and early-career researchers were arguably most impacted by the cancellation of the networking and learning
opportunities that conferences present, CCNS was designed as a “trainee-focused” meeting, highlighted by tutorial talks
beginning each session, panel discussions with both established and early-career scientists, and a spotlight on trainee
presentations.</p><p>The <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008485">first edition of CCNS</a> was planned and implemented entirely in ten weeks and yielded a meeting with more than 450
registrants, including representation from every continent across the globe. Perhaps most importantly, the limited costs
of the virtual setting allowed the meeting to be completely free of charge for all attendees. Every element of the meeting
remains available for replay online, another benefit of the virtual setting. This success served as the impetus for making
CCNS a recurring academic meeting.</p><p>Going forward, CCNS will continue to highlight cutting-edge computational neuroscience research, both in Canada and around
the world, while providing unique learning, networking, and presentation opportunities for early-career researchers. The
meeting is committed to remaining cost-accessible to the entire academic community, using the virtual setting to maximize
accessibility for populations for which physical conferences present a challenge, and maintaining a gender-balanced and
diverse lineup of speakers during its continued evolution.</p></article><article id=02-organizing-committee><h2 class=major>02 - Organizing Committee</h2><span class="image main"><img src alt></span><figure class="image main"><img src=images/screenshot.png></figure><h2 id=about-the-organizing-committee>About the Organizing Committee</h2><p><a href=http://scottrich.strikingly.com/><strong>Dr. Scott Rich</strong></a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/RichCompNeuro>@RichCompNeuro</a>, <em><strong>CCNS lead organizer</strong></em>) is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Neuron to Brain laboratory team lead at the Krembil Brain Institute.
His research aims to elucidate the multi-scale interactions driving physiological brain activity by better understanding how they are disrupted in epilepsy, a distinctly multi-scale pathology. This work includes a focus on distinctly human epilepsy by integrating human electrophysiological data into the modeling process at varied spatial scales, ranging from biophysically detailed single neuron models to neural mass models.</p><p><a href=cognemo.com><strong>Dr. Andreea Diaconescu</strong></a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/cognemo_andreea>@cognemo_andreea</a>, <em><strong>CCNS co-organizer</strong></em>) is currently an Independent Scientist at the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. Leading the Cognitive Network Modelling team, her research focuses on developing cognitive tasks and computational models that address specific symptoms in psychiatry with a particular focus on delusions. In combination with neuroimaging and electrophysiological recordings, the aim is to assess the clinical utility of these models in prospective patient studies</p><p><a href=grifflab.com><strong>Dr. John Griffiths</strong></a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/neurodidact>@neurodidact</a>, <em><strong>CCNS co-organizer</strong></em>) is a cognitive and computational neuroscientist, with particular research interests in mathematical modelling of large-scale neural dynamics, multimodal neuroimaging data analysis methods, and brain stimulation in the context of neuropsychiatric and neurological disease. He is currently an Independent Scientist at the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at CAMH, where he leads a team focused on whole-brain and multi-scale neurophysiological modelling. He is also an Assistant Professor in the University of Toronto Departments of Psychiatry and Institute of Medical Sciences.</p><p><a href=https://sites.google.com/view/lnsbsp/home><strong>Dr. Milad Lankarany</strong></a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/MLankarany>@MLankarany</a>, <em><strong>CCNS co-organizer</strong></em>) is an Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto Instiute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, and a Scientist at the Krembil Brain Institute. The main focus of his lab&rsquo;s work is to uncover information processing mechanisms of neural systems. His goal is to understand how information is represented, propagated and computed. Understanding neural information processing will result in the development of computational algorithms and engineering techniques for the optimal controlling of the functionality of neural systems. For example, closed loop neuro-stimulators can be used to adaptively intervene with the neural system of patients with neurological disorders in order to restore the normal activity.</p></article><article id=03-speaker-spotlight><h2 class=major>03- Speaker Spotlight</h2><span class="image main"><img src alt></span><figure class="image main"><img src=images/SessionChairs_v1.png></figure><h2 id=ccnsv3-external-session-chairs>CCNSv3 External Session Chairs</h2><p><a href=https://twitter.com/Alex_Pierri_C><strong>Dr. Alexandra Chatzikalymniou</strong></a>: Dr. Chatzikalymniou has a Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Patras, Greece. She completed her PhD at the University of Toronto under the supervision of Dr. Frances Skinner, where she investigated the generation mechanism of tehta rhythms in the hippocampus. She is currently a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University at the lab of Dr. Ivan Soltesz, where she studies hippocampal sharp-wave ripples during behavior.</p><p><a href=https://www.armcintosh.com/home><strong>Dr. Randy McIntosh</strong></a>: Dr. Mcintosh&rsquo;s research program involves computational modeling and brain imaging to explore changes in cognition across the lifespan and changes in the face of brain damage or disease. The program builds on an international collaboration that delivered TheVirtualBrain (thevirtualbrain.org) and integrates research efforts globally to accelerate research and translation. The goals are 1) to integrate the modeling platform into the standard workflow for clinical decision support, and 2) develop a cloud-based system where anyone can create brain models for research, clinical use, or education.</p><p><a href=https://cognemo.com/karvelis/><strong>Dr. Povilas Karvelis</strong></a>: Dr. Povilas Karvelis is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Cognitive Network Modelling lab at the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. His primary research is focused on developing computational models of the vulnerabilities underlying suicidality. The purpose of these models is two-fold. First, it can help formalize our understanding of suicidality across different levels of analysis (neural, behavioral, phenomenological, social). Second, these exact models could (eventually) be used in clinical practice to aid diagnosis and guide personalized care.</p><h2 id=speakers-for-ccnsv3>Speakers for CCNSv3</h2><ul><li><strong>Dr. Willy Wong</strong></li><li><strong>Dr. Steven Prescott</strong></li><li><strong>Dr. Carmen Canavier</strong></li><li><strong>Dr. Gaute Einevoll</strong></li><li><strong>Dr. Kelly Shen</strong></li><li><a href=https://github.com/estefanysuarez><strong>Laura Suarez</strong></a>: Laura Suárez is a PhD candidate in the Neuroscience program at McGill University.
