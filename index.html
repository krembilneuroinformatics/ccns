of traditional neuroscience conferences during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, including two such meetings
amongst the Canadian neuroscience community. The absence of these meetings presented an opportunity to create a brand-new,
entirely virtual academic meeting that could take full advantage of the online setting. Given that traditionally-defined
trainees and early-career researchers were arguably most impacted by the cancellation of the networking and learning
opportunities that conferences present, CCNS was designed as a “trainee-focused” meeting, highlighted by tutorial talks
beginning each session, panel discussions with both established and early-career scientists, and a spotlight on trainee
presentations.</p><p>The <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008485">first edition of CCNS</a> was planned and implemented entirely in ten weeks and yielded a meeting with more than 450
registrants, including representation from every continent across the globe. Perhaps most importantly, the limited costs
of the virtual setting allowed the meeting to be completely free of charge for all attendees. Every element of the meeting
remains available for replay online, another benefit of the virtual setting. This success served as the impetus for making
CCNS a recurring academic meeting.</p><p>Going forward, CCNS will continue to highlight cutting-edge computational neuroscience research, both in Canada and around
the world, while providing unique learning, networking, and presentation opportunities for early-career researchers. The
meeting is committed to remaining cost-accessible to the entire academic community, using the virtual setting to maximize
accessibility for populations for which physical conferences present a challenge, and maintaining a gender-balanced and
diverse lineup of speakers during its continued evolution.</p></article><article id=02-organizing-committee><h2 class=major>02 - Organizing Committee</h2><span class="image main"><img src alt></span><figure class="image main"><img src=images/screenshot.png></figure><h2 id=about-the-organizing-committee>About the Organizing Committee</h2><p><a href=http://scottrich.strikingly.com/><strong>Dr. Scott Rich</strong></a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/RichCompNeuro>@RichCompNeuro</a>, <em><strong>CCNS lead organizer</strong></em>) is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Neuron to Brain laboratory team lead at the Krembil Brain Institute.
His research aims to elucidate the multi-scale interactions driving physiological brain activity by better understanding how they are disrupted in epilepsy, a distinctly multi-scale pathology. This work includes a focus on distinctly human epilepsy by integrating human electrophysiological data into the modeling process at varied spatial scales, ranging from biophysically detailed single neuron models to neural mass models.</p><p><a href=cognemo.com><strong>Dr. Andreea Diaconescu</strong></a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/cognemo_andreea>@cognemo_andreea</a>, <em><strong>CCNS co-organizer</strong></em>) is currently an Independent Scientist at the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. Leading the Cognitive Network Modelling team, her research focuses on developing cognitive tasks and computational models that address specific symptoms in psychiatry with a particular focus on delusions. In combination with neuroimaging and electrophysiological recordings, the aim is to assess the clinical utility of these models in prospective patient studies</p><p><a href=grifflab.com><strong>Dr. John Griffiths</strong></a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/neurodidact>@neurodidact</a>, <em><strong>CCNS co-organizer</strong></em>) is a cognitive and computational neuroscientist, with particular research interests in mathematical modelling of large-scale neural dynamics, multimodal neuroimaging data analysis methods, and brain stimulation in the context of neuropsychiatric and neurological disease. He is currently an Independent Scientist at the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at CAMH, where he leads a team focused on whole-brain and multi-scale neurophysiological modelling. He is also an Assistant Professor in the University of Toronto Departments of Psychiatry and Institute of Medical Sciences.</p><p><a href=https://sites.google.com/view/lnsbsp/home><strong>Dr. Milad Lankarany</strong></a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/MLankarany>@MLankarany</a>, <em><strong>CCNS co-organizer</strong></em>) is an Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto Instiute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, and a Scientist at the Krembil Brain Institute. The main focus of his lab&rsquo;s work is to uncover information processing mechanisms of neural systems. His goal is to understand how information is represented, propagated and computed. Understanding neural information processing will result in the development of computational algorithms and engineering techniques for the optimal controlling of the functionality of neural systems. For example, closed loop neuro-stimulators can be used to adaptively intervene with the neural system of patients with neurological disorders in order to restore the normal activity.</p></article><article id=03-speaker-spotlight><h2 class=major>03- Speaker Spotlight</h2><span class="image main"><img src alt></span><figure class="image main"><img src=images/new_brain_1.png></figure><h2 id=session-chairs-for-ccnsv2>Session Chairs for CCNSv2</h2><p><a href=https://sites.google.com/site/mauriziodepitta/>Dr. Maurizio de Pitta</a>: Maurizio De Pitta is joining the Krembil Research Institute, setting up his lab at the Institute by August 2021. He is currently ‘la Caixa’ Junior Leader Research Fellow at the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics in Bilbao, Spain where he carries out multidisciplinary research in Applied Mathematics with emphasis on translational and clinical topics in the Neurosciences. Maurizio pioneers computational approaches to quantify and replicate neuron-glial interactions in the brain, with the aim to elucidate their role in cognition and pathology. He is co-author of the first book on “Computational Glioscience” by Springer (2019).</p><p><a href=https://www.haybrainlab.com/research>Dr. Etay Hay</a>: Dr. Etay Hay is an Independent Scientist at Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, and an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry and the Department of Physiology at the University of Toronto. Dr. Hay’s research uses computational models of cortical microcircuits to study the mechanisms of brain processing in health and mental disorders. Dr. Hay and his team integrate human cellular, circuit and gene-expression data to develop detailed computational models of human cortical microcircuits in health, depression and schizophrenia. The Hay lab uses the models to better understand the neuronal circuit mechanisms of brain function and mental health, test in silico new pharmacology for treatment, and identify high-resolution biomarkers in clinically-relevant brain signals to improve the diagnosis and monitoring of mental health.</p><p><a href="https://www.medschool.lsuhsc.edu/neuroscience/faculty_detail.aspx?name=canavier_carmen">Dr. Carmen Canavier</a>: Carmen Canavier is the Mullins Professor and Chair, Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, School of Medicine, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center at New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO). She is a computational neuroscientist studying synchronization of pulse-coupled oscillators and the nonlinear dynamics of neurons and neural circuits.
