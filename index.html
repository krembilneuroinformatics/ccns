of traditional neuroscience conferences during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, including two such meetings
amongst the Canadian neuroscience community. The absence of these meetings presented an opportunity to create a brand-new,
entirely virtual academic meeting that could take full advantage of the online setting. Given that traditionally-defined
trainees and early-career researchers were arguably most impacted by the cancellation of the networking and learning
opportunities that conferences present, CCNS was designed as a “trainee-focused” meeting, highlighted by tutorial talks
beginning each session, panel discussions with both established and early-career scientists, and a spotlight on trainee
presentations.</p><p>The <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008485">first edition of CCNS</a> was planned and implemented entirely in ten weeks and yielded a meeting with more than 450
registrants, including representation from every continent across the globe. Perhaps most importantly, the limited costs
of the virtual setting allowed the meeting to be completely free of charge for all attendees. Every element of the meeting
remains available for replay online, another benefit of the virtual setting. This success served as the impetus for making
CCNS a recurring academic meeting.</p><p>Going forward, CCNS will continue to highlight cutting-edge computational neuroscience research, both in Canada and around
the world, while providing unique learning, networking, and presentation opportunities for early-career researchers. The
meeting is committed to remaining cost-accessible to the entire academic community, using the virtual setting to maximize
accessibility for populations for which physical conferences present a challenge, and maintaining a gender-balanced and
diverse lineup of speakers during its continued evolution.</p></article><article id=02-organizing-committee><h2 class=major>02 - Organizing Committee</h2><span class="image main"><img src alt></span><figure class="image main"><img src=images/screenshot.png></figure><h2 id=about-the-organizing-committee>About the Organizing Committee</h2><p><a href=http://scottrich.strikingly.com/><strong>Dr. Scott Rich</strong></a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/RichCompNeuro>@RichCompNeuro</a>, <em><strong>CCNS lead organizer</strong></em>) is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow and Neuron to Brain laboratory team lead at the Krembil Brain Institute.
His research aims to elucidate the multi-scale interactions driving physiological brain activity by better understanding how they are disrupted in epilepsy, a distinctly multi-scale pathology. This work includes a focus on distinctly human epilepsy by integrating human electrophysiological data into the modeling process at varied spatial scales, ranging from biophysically detailed single neuron models to neural mass models.</p><p><a href=cognemo.com><strong>Dr. Andreea Diaconescu</strong></a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/cognemo_andreea>@cognemo_andreea</a>, <em><strong>CCNS co-organizer</strong></em>) is currently an Independent Scientist at the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health. Leading the Cognitive Network Modelling team, her research focuses on developing cognitive tasks and computational models that address specific symptoms in psychiatry with a particular focus on delusions. In combination with neuroimaging and electrophysiological recordings, the aim is to assess the clinical utility of these models in prospective patient studies</p><p><a href=grifflab.com><strong>Dr. John Griffiths</strong></a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/neurodidact>@neurodidact</a>, <em><strong>CCNS co-organizer</strong></em>) is a cognitive and computational neuroscientist, with particular research interests in mathematical modelling of large-scale neural dynamics, multimodal neuroimaging data analysis methods, and brain stimulation in the context of neuropsychiatric and neurological disease. He is currently an Independent Scientist at the Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics at CAMH, where he leads a team focused on whole-brain and multi-scale neurophysiological modelling. He is also an Assistant Professor in the University of Toronto Departments of Psychiatry and Institute of Medical Sciences.</p><p><a href=https://sites.google.com/view/lnsbsp/home><strong>Dr. Milad Lankarany</strong></a> (<a href=https://twitter.com/MLankarany>@MLankarany</a>, <em><strong>CCNS co-organizer</strong></em>) is an Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto Instiute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, and a Scientist at the Krembil Brain Institute. The main focus of his lab&rsquo;s work is to uncover information processing mechanisms of neural systems. His goal is to understand how information is represented, propagated and computed. Understanding neural information processing will result in the development of computational algorithms and engineering techniques for the optimal controlling of the functionality of neural systems. For example, closed loop neuro-stimulators can be used to adaptively intervene with the neural system of patients with neurological disorders in order to restore the normal activity.</p></article><article id=03-speaker-spotlight><h2 class=major>03- Speaker Spotlight</h2><span class="image main"><img src alt></span><h2 id=ccnsv4-keynote-speakers>CCNSv4 Keynote Speakers</h2><p><a href=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mental-health/mental-health-awareness-week/meet-dr-rick-adams><strong>Dr. Rick Adams</strong></a>: Bio coming soon!</p><p><a href=https://www.uottawa.ca/brain/people/lefebvre-jeremie><strong>Dr. Jeremie Lefebvre</strong></a>: Bio coming soon!</p><p><a href=https://www.buffalo.edu/cas/math/people/faculty/muldoon.html><strong>Dr. Sarah Muldoon</strong></a>: Bio coming soon!</p></article><article id=04-ccns-2023-program><h2 class=major>04 - CCNS 2023 Program</h2><span class="image main"><img src alt></span><h3 id=ccnsv4-will-take-place-on-october-5-6-2023-and-registration-is-open-herecrowdcastiocccnsv4>CCNSv4 will take place on October 5-6, 2023, and registration is open <a href=CROWDCAST.IO/C/CCNSV4>here</a>.</h3><h3 id=submit-your-abstract-for-a-trainee-talk-herehttpsdocsgooglecomformsde1faipqlseev-ea5ccwkapzrv43xd4nfdygydeaiwptuv4b_7gkkrwpoqviewformuspsf_link-by-september-1-for-full-consideration>Submit your abstract for a Trainee Talk <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeev-EA5ccwKapzRV43xD4NfDYGyDeAiWpTuv4b_7GKkrWPOQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a> by September 1 for full consideration.</h3><h1 id=about-ccnsv4>About CCNSv4:</h1><h2 id=what-is-the-canadian-computational-neuroscience-spotlight-ccns>What is the Canadian Computational Neuroscience Spotlight (CCNS)?</h2><p>The Canadian Computational Neuroscience Spotlight (CCNS) was created following the mass cancellations and postponements of traditional neuroscience conferences during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, including two such meetings amongst the Canadian neuroscience community.

Every element of these meetings remain available for replay online, another benefit of the virtual setting.

Taking place the same week (October 5-6), CCNS will capitalize on this momentum in the Canadian computational neuroscience community with an even stronger emphasis on trainee engagement, including workshop-style sessions and more opportunity for spotlighted trainee talks.</p><h2 id=whats-returning-from-previous-editions>What&rsquo;s returning from previous editions?</h2><p>CCNS will include three keynote addresses from world-class computational neuroscientists. Our continuing “trainee focus” will include more opportunities for spotlighted trainee talks alongside additional parallel sessions. Like each previous CCNS, the meeting will be entirely virtual, allowing for zero registration costs and material that is available online for replay indefinitely.</p><h2 id=who-is-speaking>Who is speaking?</h2><p>CCNSv4&rsquo;s three keynote speakers, Dr. Rick Adams, Dr. Jeremie Lefebvre, and Dr. Sarah Muldoon, are confirmed. Members of the organizing committee will compliment these keynote addresses with “workshop-style” sessions to provide hands-on experience in related topics. The remaining talks will be from selected trainees.
The list of speakers and meeting schedule will be updated at ccnsmeeting.ca on a rolling basis.</p><h2 id=i-want-to-give-a-trainee-talk-what-should-i-do>I want to give a trainee talk! What should I do?</h2><p>We invite trainees to submit abstracts for talks covering any subject falling under the broad banner of computational neuroscience. To do so, fill out this Google Form. We anticipate all submissions that reasonably fall under the broad banner of &ldquo;computational neuroscience&rdquo; will be accepted unless the demand far exceeds our expectations.</p><p>Submissions before September 1 at 5 pm EDT will be considered for longer “spotlight” presentations, with preference given to topics that compliment the topics of our keynote speakers (computational study of epilepsy, psychiatry, myelin, and the stability/resilience of neuronal circuits). The exact length of the talks will depend on demand and be established when our schedule is finalized, no later than September 18.</p><h2 id=wait-do-i-have-to-be-canadian-to-attend-or-present>Wait, do I have to be Canadian to attend or present?</h2><p>This meeting was first designed as a “Canadian” spotlight event considering the COVID-19 related cancellations or postponements of many neuroscience meetings in Canada specifically. However, the meeting quickly grew to not only include an international group of speakers, but also attendees from across the globe. As such, while we endeavor to shine a spotlight on the burgeoning computational neuroscience community within Canada, this meeting is designed for an international audience, and everyone is encouraged to register and apply for trainee talks.</p><h1 id=tentative-program>Tentative Program</h1><h3 id=thursday-october-5>Thursday, October 5</h3><ul><li>9:00 AM EDT: <strong>Welcome and Introduction: Dr. Scott Rich</strong></li><li>9:15 AM EDT: <strong>Keynote: Dr. Rick Adams</strong></li><li>10:15 AM EDT: <strong>Break</strong></li><li>10:30 AM EDT: <strong>Tutorial #1</strong></li><li>11:00 AM EDT: <strong>Trainee Spotlight Talks</strong></li><li>11:30 AM EDT: <strong>Parallel Trainee Talks</strong></li><li>12:30 PM EDT: <strong>Lunch Break</strong></li><li>1:30 PM EDT: <strong>Panel Discussion</strong></li><li>2:15 PM EDT: <strong>Keynote: Dr. Jeremie Lefebvre</strong></li><li>3:15 PM EDT: <strong>Break</strong></li><li>3:30 PM EDT: <strong>Tutorial #2</strong></li><li>4:00 PM EDT: <strong>Trainee Spotlight Talks</strong></li><li>4:30 PM EDT: <strong>Parallel Trainee Talks</strong></li></ul><h3 id=friday-october-6>Friday, October 6</h3><ul><li>9:00 AM EDT: <strong>Trainee Spotlight Talks</strong></li><li>9:30 AM EDT: <strong>Parallel Trainee Talks</strong></li><li>10:00 AM EDT: <strong>Break</strong></li><li>10:15 AM EDT: <strong>Keynote: Dr. Sarah Muldoon</strong></li><li>11:45 AM EDT: <strong>Concluding Remarks</strong></li></ul><h2 id=trainee-abstracts>Trainee Abstracts</h2><p>Coming Soon!</p></article><article id=05-past-future><h2 class=major>05 - Past & Future</h2><span class="image main"><img src alt></span><h2 id=previous-years>Previous Years</h2><h3 id=ccns-2022>CCNS 2022</h3><p>The full program of talks at CCNSv3, including sessions chaired by Dr. Alexandra Chatzikalymniou, Dr. Randy McIntosh, Dr. Milad Lankarany, and Drs.
